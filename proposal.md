MyGameSite

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that hosts the games I will make.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The site will have a variety of games to be accessed and played with information on each game and other sources relating to the contents and inspiration/production of the games. Each game would be notable different from each other in design and purpose. There will be a main page which would have an introduction to the site and showcase each game. Indivdual pages for each game and a page for the history of the site and the development of each game and future plans.
